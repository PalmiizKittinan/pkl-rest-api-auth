* **Social Login Compatible** - Works with social login plugins (Google, Facebook, etc.)
* **User-Friendly Interface** - Easy API key generation and management
* **Developer Friendly** - Comprehensive documentation and examples

= Authentication Methods =

1. **Bearer Token**: `Authorization: Bearer your_key`
2. **Header**: `X-API-Key: your_key`
3. **Form-data**: Add `api_key` to your form data
4. **Query Parameter**: Add `?api_key=your_key` to URL

* Unique API keys for each user
* Admin can revoke/restore access
* Control root REST API endpoint access

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I generate an API key? =

Go to your WordPress admin → Users → Your Profile, scroll down to "REST API Access" section, and click "Generate API Key".

= Can I use this with social login plugins? =

Yes! This plugin is designed to work with social login systems where users don't have traditional passwords.

= How do I use the API key? =

Include your API key in requests using:
- Bearer token: `Authorization: Bearer your_key`
- Header: `X-API-Key: your_key`
- Form-data: `api_key: your_key`
- Query parameter: `?api_key=your_key`

= Is this secure? =

Yes. API keys are unique, unguessable, and can only be generated by authenticated users through the WordPress admin interface.

You can enable/disable access to the wp-json root endpoint (./wp-json) from the admin settings page for enhanced security.
