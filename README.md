A lightweight WordPress plugin that controls access to the REST API by requiring user authentication.  
This helps improve security by preventing unauthorized access to REST API endpoints for non-logged-in users.

- Restricts REST API access to logged-in users only.
- Blocks unauthenticated requests with customizable settings.
- Provides admin settings page to enable/disable authentication requirement.
- Multilingual support with WordPress text domain.
- Simple and lightweight, no external dependencies.

## Usage

- When enabled, the plugin blocks unauthenticated access to the WordPress REST API.  
- If a non-logged-in user tries to access the API, they will receive a `401 Unauthorized` error:  

```json
{
  "code": "rest_not_logged_in",
  "message": "You are not currently logged in.",
  "data": {
    "status": 401
  }
}
```

- If a logged-in user does not have sufficient permissions, they will receive a `403 Forbidden` error:  

```json
{
  "code": "rest_insufficient_permissions",
  "message": "You do not have sufficient permissions to access this API.",
  "data": {
    "status": 403
  }
}
```

---

## Settings

Navigate to **Settings → PKL REST API Auth** in your WordPress admin dashboard:

- **Enable REST API Authentication**  
  - ✅ Checked: Only logged-in users can access the REST API.  
  - ⬜ Unchecked: REST API remains open as usual.
